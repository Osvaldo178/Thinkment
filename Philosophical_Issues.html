        <td><h2>The Difference Between Socialism and Communism</h2> <p>There is a common misconception between Socialism and Communism being the same idea, but that is false. Both ideologies may originate from the same principals but they differe from idea, economics, and government. Socialism focuses on the aspect that workers or communities shoudl own the means of producion, and shouldn't be owned by private investors or wealthy owners. The economic aspect of Socialism fouses on community ownership and operation of production is focused on use, and not for profit. A socialist government owns the means of production, and the government is in charge of driving production and distrubution for the sole intent of use only. Communism is a more radical form of socialism, or as considered, "true socialism." Instead of community own production, its focused on individual own means of production, that is paid based the ability and nedds that person can achieve. A communist economy tends to rely on individual production, and the wealth to be distributed equally, as the communist society is classless. A communist government controls the production, property, and distribues the wealth, as the government tends to be more authoritarian with its control. </p></td>

        <td><h2>The Struggle Between Both ideas</h2> <p>Communism and Capitalism are heavily argued whether both systems are better to practice. Capitalists claim there idea allows more freedom in practicing competition, and regulating profit, while Communists claim there idea is more neutral and accepting, without the fear of competition. Communism however has never been practiced, as each "communist" government that has formed, has been a tolitorian society  that fulfills only the government itself. The same can be said for Capitalism, as a Capitalist society has always revolved in mixed economies and socialist practices.</p></td>
